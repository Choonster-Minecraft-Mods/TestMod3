# Test Mod 3

This is a Minecraft Forge 1.19 mod that I use to test various things (mainly code for people in the Minecraft
Forum [Modification Development](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/modification-development)
section and the Minecraft Forge
[Modder Support](https://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/forum/70-modder-support/) section).

It's not supposed to be a complete or working mod.

**WARNING: The 1.19 update is still a work in progress. Not everything is working yet.**
